          Global warming is rise in average temperature of Earth's climate. It have been observed since 1880. The annual
          temperature of our Earth increased was increased by 0.07 degree Celsius from 1880 to 1980. After then, the rate seems to
          increase at the rate of 0.18 degree Celsius per decade and now, in this industrial era, the rates are 2 degree Celsius
          per decade. 2016 was the hottest year on record, but that record was very close to be broken several times on 2019 and
          2020.
          Some of them might think that the changes are very low, but they are wrong.

              The main cause of global warming is the combustion of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, natural gases and gasoline. And
              why we are manufacturing fossils fuels in this large scale is because, it is literally used in powering our whole world,
              like...
              <br>
              &#9733; Generating electricity by burning fossil fuels.
              <br>
              &#9733; Manufacturing goods.
              <br>
              &#9733; Cutting down forests releases the carbon they have been storing, each year approx. 12 million hectares of forest are
              cut.
              <br>
              &#9733; Most transportation vehicles runs on fossil fuels.
              <br>
              &#9733; The byproduct by the combustion are heat-trapping pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, synthetic
              fluorinated gases which heats up the globe via greenhouse effect.
              <br>
              &#9733; Global warming have other effects rather than just warming of the globe. The increase in temperature causes,
              <br>
              &#9733; Melting of ice which cause rise in sea level which then leads to flood in coastal areas.
              <br>
              &#9733; Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal to extinction.
              <br>
              &#9733; Drying out already-arid areas, disappearing glaciers, early snow-melt and severe droughts will cause more water
              shortages and continue to increase the risk of wildfires.
              <br>
              &#9733; Extreme weather by disrupting the delicate balance of the oceans.
              <br>
              &#9733; Allergies, asthma and other infectious disease will outbreak due to increase in growth of pollen-producing ragweed,
              higher levels of air pollution and the spread of conditions favorable to pathogens and mosquitoes.

          To prevent this, we still must limit carbon pollution and replace fossil fuels with cleaner power source.
          Here are some ways to prevent global warming,
          <br>
          &#9733; Power your home with renewable energy like wind or solar energy.
          <br>
          &#9733; Saving water reduces carbon pollution as it takes a lot of energy to pump, heat and treat water.
          <br>
          &#9733; Switching to gas-smart cars such as hybrids and fully electric vehicles, saves fuel and money.
          <br>
          &#9733; Switch to compact fluorescent light bulb which will save 70 kg of carbon dioxide a year.
          <br>
          &#9733; Planting a single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.
          <br>
          &#9733; Recycling just half of your household waster can save nearly one ton of carbon dioxide per year.
